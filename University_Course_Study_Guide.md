## 🧠 General Study & Exam Strategies

- **Concept Maps**: Link related ideas (e.g., Energy ↔ Work ↔ Heat ↔ Potential)
- **Flashcards**: Use Anki for terms, laws, and formulas.
- **Problem-Solving**: Daily practice is essential; aim for 5–10 problems/day.
- **Simulations**: Use Phet and ChemCollective for labs and visuals.
- **Peer Teaching**: Explain topics to friends—it strengthens your understanding.
